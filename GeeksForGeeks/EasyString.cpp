/*
 * You are given the string S . Compress the string when lower and upper cases are the same.
 * In compressed string characters should be in lowercase.

Example 1:

Input: S = "aaABBb"
Output: "3a3b"
Explanation: As 'a' appears 3 times
consecutively and 'b' also 3 times,
and 'b' and 'B' considered as same.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: S = "aaacca"
Output: "3a2c1a"
Explanation: As 'a' appears 3 times
consecutively and 'c' also 2 times,
and then 'a' 1 time.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function transform()
which takes the string S as inputs and returns the compressed string.
