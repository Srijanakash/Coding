/*
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s 
present in the array together in any place in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
Example 3:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
Example 4:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 8
